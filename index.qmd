# Welcome to the Agawu Lab

We are a research group at **Children's Hospital Los Angeles** and **USC Keck School of Medicine** focused on improving clinical outcomes for children with complex gastrointestinal conditions.

Our work combines **clinical epidemiology**, **caregiver-centered outcomes research**, and **data science** to understand and address the challenges facing pediatric patients with intestinal failure and their families.
